      "title": "TROPIC THUNDER: The Review",
      "heroImage": "assets/tropicThunder.jpg",
      "body": "Ben Stiller's action comedy is a satire of action comedies, we think, writes Donald Clarke WHEN discussing a film that trades so promiscuously in cliches, it is, perhaps, forgivable to begin by using the sort of worn-out phrase that makes careful editors quiver with disgust.\nThe makers of Tropic Thunder want to - here it comes - have their cake and eat it too. Actually, it's more complicated than that. Ben Stiller, who directs, stars and co-writes, positively demands that the viewer note and savour the simultaneous having and eating of metaphorical pastries.\nThe tension between what the film says and what the film does helps support one of a dozen (or so) layers of snarky, self-aware humour.What do I mean? Well, unless you have spent the last few months in the jungles of southeast Asia, beyond the reach of television commercials, internet stings and entertainment journalism, you will know that Tropic Thunderconcerns itself with a film crew's efforts to make a searing, hugely budgeted Vietnam epic.\nStiller turns up as a fading star of big, dumb action films. Jack Black plays a broad comedian best known for his ability to fart on demand. Steve Coogan gives us a pompous English director. Robert Downey Jr is hilarious as an Australian method actor who undergoes a \"pigmentation procedure\" in order to play an African-American soldier.\nThe cast's awful experiences call to mind Apocalypse Now, but the film they are making (also called Tropic Thunder) looks more like a combination of Platoonand Rambo II: war is hell, but, if you discharge enough ordnance, it can make you a stronger human being.\nHowever, in the final act, following a overextended, contrived showdown between the movie stars and real-life heroin growers, Stiller's Tropic Thunderappears to be playing similar games to those in the films being satirised. The gunplay is extreme and preposterous. The characters learn clunky lessons. The music swells with the rising emotions. In short, Tropic Thunderbecomes \" Tropic Thunder\".\nThere can be little doubt that Stiller intended this twisty inconsistency. After all, few recent comedies have been quite so relentless in their self-regard. Even before the film has begun, we have been assaulted by a series of superb spoof trailers for films featuring the three main cast members, and it's hard not to ponder the connections between the stars and their characters. (By \"their characters\" I mean the fake performers they play, not their characters in the film within the film. Do keep up.)\nStiller cannily sidesteps any parallels by making Tugg Speedman, his alter ego, a stranger to comedy, whereas Black's Jeff Portnoy, though as noisy and showy as his creator, occupies grubbier territory to that patrolled by the star of School of Rock.\nRobert Downey Jr does, however, bear more than a few similarities to the pretentious, over-adored Kirk Lazarus. This is a terrific performance from the resurgent Bob. The arrogance of the method actor, revealed here through Kirk's minstrel-show grimaces and dubious urban patois, has never seemed so overpoweringly monstrous.\nThe film-makers may have expected to extend the satire into the wider world by scaring up demonstrations against Downey's supposed blacking up, but it seems that the public can tell the difference between celebration and ridicule.\nOr can they? Though African-American lobbyists left their placards at home, there were protests at the film's supposed insensitivity to people with learning disabilities.\nThe contentious scenes concern an awful film called Simple Jack, in which Tugg gives a grossly offensive impersonation of a mentally disabled man. Though the characters do make liberal use of the word \"retard\", Stiller is clearly seeking to point up Hollywood's disgraceful record of sentimentalising and patronising the mentally challenged.\nThe awareness that the protesters stayed away from Forrest Gumpand I Am Sambut felt the need to shout at a film that, despite its irreverence, deplores such cheesy representations, adds yet one more parcel of irony to an already overstuffed basket. You can only laugh.",

      "body": "\"Shaun of the Dead\" is a horror-comedy that follows a slacker named Shaun, played by Simon Pegg, as he and his friends try to survive a zombie apocalypse in London. The movie is a hilarious and clever send-up of the zombie genre, and has become a cult classic since its release.\n\nThe humor in the movie is sharp and witty, and the movie is filled with clever nods to classic horror films.

      "body": "\"Superbad\" is a raunchy teen comedy that follows two best friends, played by Jonah Hill and Michael Cera, as they navigate their way through high school and prepare for college. The movie is a hilarious and heartwarming tale of friendship and growing up that has become a classic of the genre.\n\nThe chemistry between Hill and Cera is electric, and their dynamic drives the movie forward. The movie is filled with hilarious and memorable moments, from the awkward teenage conversations to the absurd and outrageous antics. The supporting cast is also fantastic, with standout performances from Christopher Mintz-Plasse and Emma Stone.\n\nBut what sets \"Superbad\" apart from other teen comedies is its heart. The movie manages to balance its crude humor with genuine emotional moments that hit home. The movie is about more than just getting drunk and hooking up - it's about the fear and excitement of growing up and facing the unknown.\n\nOverall, \"Superbad\" is a classic coming-of-age comedy that has stood the test of time. It's a hilarious and heartfelt movie that captures the awkwardness and excitement of adolescence in a way that few movies have. If you haven't seen \"Superbad\" yet, you're missing out on one of the best comedies of the 2000s.",

      "title": "Renfield! A Sucky Movie or a Fun Ride?",
      "heroImage": "assets/renfieldImage.jpg",
      "body": "Count Dracula has been dead for so long and gone through so many iterations — exotic, satanic, romantic — that it’s almost surprising there’s any juice left in the thirsty old boy. Yet here he is again, resurrected by a glorious, vamping Nicolas Cage, swinging a cape, baring his fangs and stealing his every scene. The Count is playing second banana in “Renfield,” but he’s nevertheless a main attraction in this cheerfully disposable entertainment, which perfectly understands that sometimes all you want from a movie is 93 minutes of well-wrought absurdity.\nI imagine that the pitch to the studio went something like this: “It’s today, and Dracula (we’d love to get Cage) is in New Orleans for the tax breaks, out of money and, long story short, almost drained of his powers. He’s basically toast, and our guy, the Count’s unhappy servant, Renfield (a Nicholas Hoult type, relatable, smooth, good-looking) — after years of groveling and scarfing bugs — has had it. We want to make this a rocking action movie, with lots of blood and kick-ass fights, but also funny, so Renfield enters a codependency group to purge his personal demon. Has anyone heard of Stuart Smalley?”\nThat’s more or less how “Renfield” plays, and while it’s wittier and slicker than my spurious studio-speak, it is about as condensed. Fast, tight and blunt, the movie gets right to the point with a characteristically American mix of therapy-speak and jokey violence, and it largely stays on point. The filmmakers — Robert Kirkman cooked up the story, Ryan Ridley wrote the script and Chris McKay directed — don’t laboriously reintroduce Dracula, exhume his origin story or invent a childhood trauma to somehow explain him. After a century of pop-culture celebrity and box-office success there’s no need: He is what he is, a vampire.\nHe’s also, unsurprisingly given the job’s grisly requirements, a terrible boss, which the movie uses to economically establish how the long-suffering Renfield joins the support group. There, coaxed by the group’s leader (Brandon Scott Jones) and surrounded by glum faces and chirpy affirmations, Renfield confronts his low self-esteem and reliance on his toxic benefactor. He listens and he shares, and while the other members are puzzled by the odder details of his relationship, the group boosts his confidence enough that he embarks on a lifestyle makeover. He combs his hair, brightens his color palette, finds his smile.\nYou don’t need to know Stuart Smalley — the unsinkable positive thinker first created and performed by Al Franken on “Saturday Night Live” in 1991 — to enjoy Renfield’s transformation. (Franken also played the character in Harold Ramis’s 1995 film “Stuart Saves His Family” — it’s good!) But knowing Stuart sweetens the joke that Renfield, described in Bram Stoker’s novel as “morbidly excitable,” would embark on journey of hopeful self-invention. Whether or not Smalley served as an inspiration, this movie works partly because, for all the comedy it wrings from the support group, it takes the sincerity of Renfield’s journey seriously (enough).\nHoult externalizes Renfield’s turmoil with precision — his open, lucid face waxes and wanes with dread and optimism — and a mellifluous voice-over that grounds you in the story. This Renfield is nicer and certainly cuter than he’s often portrayed, and there’s little of the opportunism and none of the wild menace that made Dwight Frye’s interpretation in the 1931 “Dracula” so unnervingly memorable. Instead, Hoult invests the character with a tenderness that lets you see the person he was before he went astray. He also helps sell, passably, some flirty business with a local cop, Rebecca (Awkwafina), a foul-mouthed, half-baked iteration on the action-flick cliché of the strong female character.\nThe character is a drag, however amusingly sketched in by Awkwafina, but it isn’t a dealbreaker. Genre movies, even a hybrid like “Renfield” (which, like so many movies now, effectively becomes a superhero movie) depend on conventions; what matters is how they’re worked, tweaked, recast. McKay and company have loaded the movie with other familiar fixings, too — gangsters, corrupt cops, a dead parent, truckloads of corpses — but for the most part they’ve done so with an insistently light, at times surprisingly warm touch. Like Cage’s Dracula, who lights the darkness with great delicacy, a sharply honed, knowing smile and a voice that purrs only to roar, the filmmakers are having fun, not world-building and mythmaking. What a relief!",

      "title": "Saving Private Ryan: A Review",
      "heroImage": "assets/sprMovie.jpg",
      "body": "There are movies and then there are movies.\nAnd then there is Steven Spielberg's \"Saving Private Ryan.\"\n\nSearing, heartbreaking, so intense it turns your body into a single tube of clenched muscle, this is simply the greatest war movie ever made, and one of the great American movies. In one stroke, it makes everything that came before – with the exception of two or three obscure European variants on the same theme – seem dated and unwatchable. And it redefines the way we look at war.\n\nGenerically, it could be called the last example of that vanished category, the unit tribute film. But this unit is not the 2nd Ranger Battalion or the 101st Airborne. Rather, it is a generation: those men born in the late 1910s and early '20s, who, when asked, simply put aside their tools and settled the great issue of the century, determining who would administer the industrial revolution, dictatorship or democracy. They did this without complaint, bitterness, anger or remorse. Then they came home and picked up their tools again. To this day, few will talk about what they saw and did, and Spielberg shows us why.\n\nIn the first seconds you understand you are in a different place than you've ever been before, unless you survived the Normandy invasion. You're in a Higgins boat in the gray dawn of June 6, 1944, wet and cold and already exhausted, scudding through the sloppy surf, and all around you men are puking. The noise is astonishing. Your hands tremble; your breath comes in dry, hurtful spurts.\n\nThen the landing gate falls and in the very first instant, zeroed German machine gun fire spits through the boat. At this moment you'll wish you were elsewhere, as did surely every man in the real thing. In Spielberg's terrifying version, the bullets seem somehow angry – they pierce the air, trailing a whine or a streak of neon illumination, and when they strike sand or steel, they kick up big, vicious geysers; and there are so many of them, and they come so fastfastfast. But when they strike flesh, they strike it with a thudding finality that reduces a man to maimed meat in a sixth of a second, and takes it all away from him, so that he falls forward obedient only to gravity. He dies like a sack of potatoes falling off a shelf.\n\nSpielberg's ability to capture the palpable madness of all this borders on the incredible. The first 25 minutes of the film – a re-creation of Omaha Beach from the point of view of an all-too-human Ranger captain, who's been here and done this, but not at this level of violence – is surely one of the great tours de force of world cinema. From the spillage of viscera, the shearing of limbs, the gushing of blood and the psychotic whimsy of the bullets, to a final kind of fog of panic and soul-deep fear, he makes you glad it was your daddy's job, and not yours.\n\nBut Spielberg also understands war's deepest reality, which is that being there is not enough, and being willing to die for your country is also not enough; you have to be willing to kill for your country. So much of the battle carnage pictured in \"Saving Private Ryan\" is based on the craft of close-quarter, small-unit combat: It's watching men maneuver across terrain for geometrical superiority, hunting for a position to vector fire in on the enemy. He who shoots from the best position and brings the most fire to bear, he's the winner. The thermodynamics of infantry combat: Shoot well, shoot fast, shoot often.\n\nWhere does this unprecedented version of war come from? It may come out of a few other movies, ironically all of them German. I think of \"Das Brucke\" (\"The Bridge\"), \"The Winter War\" (actually Finnish, about the short, brutal Russo-Finn war of 1940), or \"Stalingrad\" or even \"Das Boot\" – all movies that portrayed unflinchingly the iron randomness of war. But more vividly, it has clearly been informed by a close study of as much archival footage of The Real Thing as can be had. In this sense, it's ersatz documentary, with desaturated '40s color, jittery, terrified camera movement (you feel the cameraman's fear of getting hit) and the sensation of overwhelming chaos.\n\nIt's mean, terrifying, exhausting and quipless. There's no spunk and very little humor. Morale is nonexistent. It's a grinding, debasing job carried out in physical misery in an environment – mud, rain, cold – that is itself an enemy. It's Bill Mauldin's Willie and Joe without the punch lines, but with a lot of dead GIs and a crushing melancholy hanging over everything like smoke.\n\nBut this will become evident only in time. Initially, we are in such a fog from the intensity of the invasion sequence that fatigue is the only response: A few survivors eat K-rations and try to decompress from the pressurized brutality they've both suffered and dealt. Word comes: a mission.\n\nHere the movie broadens somewhat, for just a moment: Two Ryan brothers have died in the invasion and a third has just perished in New Guinea. Mrs. Ryan, of Every Farm, U.S.A., will get three letters on the same day. But it seems there's a fourth Ryan, James (Matt Damon), the youngest, somewhere with the advance units of the 101st Airborne in the small French towns that cover the approach to the beaches. No less a personage than George C. Marshall himself, the chief of staff (played by Harve Presnell with a less kitschy quality than might be expected), orders that a unit be sent out to pluck this boy from battle and return him to the farm. It's typical of Spielberg that this position is not treated glibly, as another bit of idiocy by \"the brass.\" In a spirit of decency and in accordance with what seems to be his career-long recognition of benevolent authority, he makes us see on what basis Marshall makes his decision, and how, no matter how it plays out, it represents the best of the American spirit, not the worst.\n\nEight men – that heroic captain, John Miller (Tom Hanks in another of his quietly brilliant everyman roles), a sergeant (Tom Sizemore), a Browning Automatic Rifleman (Edward Burns), a sniper (Barry Pepper), a medic (Giovanni Ribisi), two riflemen (Vin Diesel and Adam Goldberg) and an interpreter (Jeremy Davies) – are charged to cross the dangerous ground between the beachhead and the town, locate Private Ryan and bring him back alive. Or bring back his dog tags.\n\nAs pure story, the movie has a swiftness to it that goes far beyond the sheer fidelity of the battle sequences. The narrative has been expertly configured; it moves us through a variety of experiences – squad assault, town battle, sniper duel, a final stand against armored units – while at the same time keeping precise track of the overall story situation. Simultaneously, the personalities of the men are expressing themselves, in small ways. Even Damon's Ryan, who could be the font of sentimentality, turns out to be just another kid, low-key and quietly, furiously decent. (Damon, like all the actors, is excellent in this lesser role.) But it's no flashback-o-rama, in the fashion of \"The Naked and the Dead,\" where each man's life is summed up in a banal recollection. Rather – this is a point Spielberg makes over and over – these men have essentially given up on their civilian personalities – with the exception of the unit intellectual, the interpreter played by Davies – for the duration. They know the drill. They know what to do. They can hold it together. They've become, in Stephen Ambrose's wonderful term, complete Citizen Soldiers.\n\nIn this way, the film approaches its true subject, which isn't heroism, but duty, which is to say, repression. It's about men who make a conscious decision that the self does not matter; the \"personality\" is irrelevant; feelings are dangerous. Thus they become what they must, to survive, to kill and to win: sealed-off beings locked away, hoarding their emotions, giving vent only to rage. They let nothing hang out because hanging out can get you killed. And Spielberg dramatizes this point twice, explicitly, in episodes where two soldiers yield to compassion. In this cruelest of worlds, the result is catastrophe. This movie is about a generation that put its heart on the shelf, dialed its minds down into a small, cold tunnel, and fought with its brains.\n\nAll the way through you can feel Spielberg flirting with cliche, almost daring us to recognize it and then at the last moment pulling it away from us and leaving us open-mouthed. But the biggest cliche that the movie assaults is the very conceit upon which war movies have been eternally built: It is the idea that somehow, combat is cool. There's always been an athletic grace to battle as the movies have portrayed it, a kind of photogenic sportiness. Even in the most violent of battle sequences, a little boy in you thought, \"Hey, that's kinda neat.\" You know, dropping grenades on the German high command trapped underground in \"The Dirty Dozen\" or spray-painting Nazis red with your Thompson in \"The Longest Day.\" And there was that Hollywood thing where the hero ran through blizzards of fire and somehow was never touched, because, after all, he was the hero.\n\nThat's all gone here. Not merely because of its gore but far more because of its cruelty, the war here will inspire no enlistees and no one will relive it in private later. It's flat-out terrifying, and the emotion it finally produces in you is more than any other film has gotten, but about one-thousandth of what the infantrymen of 1944 must have felt after one day on the line: utter exhaustion. You feel bled out, and at least emotionally, you have been.\n\nSo in the end, this one is for the boys of Pointe-du-Hoc, and also the boys of Utah and Omaha, Salerno, Monte Cassino, Iwo, the boys who took the long walk ashore at Tarawa through the Japanese fire, the boys whose last moments were spent in a flaming Fortress over Schweinfurt, or whatever, wherever, between the years 1941 and 1945. Take a bow, little guy, it says to them.\n\nAnd to us, their inheritors, it says: Hey, look what your daddies did, what they went through, what they survived or didn't survive – and be proud. And it also asks us the hardest of all questions: Are we worthy of them?",

      "title": "The Super Mario Bros. Movie: A Winner?",
      "heroImage": "assets/marioMovie.jpg",
      "body": "When \"The Super Mario Bros. Movie\" opened in theaters earlier this month, the experts were ready to count out the computer-animated film as another disposable video-game byproduct like the colossally awful, 1993 live-action take on the 1985 Nintendo game. Not so fast.\n\nCritics jeered, but audiences came in droves. Having already cleaned up with more than $700 million worldwide, \"The Super Mario Bros. Movie\" is now the biggest box-office hit of 2023, setting records for the largest global opening ever for an animated film. How far can it go? Do I hear a billion? Easy.\n\nWhat happened? Parents starved for family entertainment, that's what happened. There's also the fact that \"The Super Mario Bros. Movie\" is way more fun even for non-gamers than skeptics predicted. Repeat business is off the charts. So get over your hesitation and jump aboard.\n\nDon't expect miracles. Even at 93 minutes, the movie can drift into dull and derivative. Still, I think it's an asset that \"The Super Mario Bros. Movie\" is aimed at 5-year-olds of all ages, meaning the child in all of us. Look elsewhere, maybe \"Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,\" for winking adult references. It's the dedication to silliness that makes \"Mario\" such an impish delight.\n\nAs directed by Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic, from a script by Matthew Fogel, the film doesn't even try to reinvent the genre. It only wants to capture enough of the joystick energy of the game to cover the sins of merch pedaling and thin plotting and characterization.\n\nFears about ethnic stereotyping emerged from the voice casting of non-Italian Chris Pratt as Mario. Relax. Pratt uses his own voice to play the mustachioed Italian plumber in overalls. Ditto Charlie Day as his shy brother Luigi. Both put on exaggerated Italian accents in a TV ad for the bros' Brooklyn plumbing business, then revert to normal. Problem solved? Pretty much.\n\nTrouble starts immediately as Mario and Luigi go underground to fix a manhole leak and are sucked into a warp pipe that sends them into two separate universes. Mario lands in the Mushroom Kingdom, ruled by Princess Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy in fine, frisky form).\n\nPoor Luigi is zapped into the Dark Lands controlled by the evil King Koopa, Bowser, a kind of demonic turtle with red eyebrows who finds the perfect verbal pairing in wild man Jack Black. Bowser yearns for Princess Peach and will destroy her kingdom if she refuses to marry him.\n\nMario, who is also hot for Peach, can't have that, plus he needs to rescue Luigi from Bowser and form an alliance with the Kong family of gorillas by showing that he -- even in a cat suit -- can win a fight with the king's son Donkey Kong (Seth Rogen doing a great Seth Rogen).\n\nGot that? No matter. The plot is just a flimsy excuse to have these characters mix it up one more time on the big screen. Live action can't cut it. The first \"Mario\" movie proved that by staying rigidly earthbound.\n\nThe real secret behind the unexpected and staggering success of \"The Super Mario Bros. Movie\" is animation, which niftily catches the anarchy of gaming. It creates the illusion that anything is possible. It's also the next best thing to playing the actual game, which continues to thrive and multiply.\n\nCan the movie spawn its own hive of sequels? Two words: Game on.",
